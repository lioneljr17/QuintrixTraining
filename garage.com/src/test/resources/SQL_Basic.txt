Create a new branch called f-sql

Sakila Database

Write a SQL statement for each of the following. 

1. Get 10 cities in descending alphabetical order.
   SELECT city
   FROM sakila.city 
   ORDER BY city DESC
   LIMIT 10;

2. Get all films with "airplane" in the title.
  SELECT title
  FROM `sakila`.`film`
  WHERE title LIKE('%airplane%');

3. Get the highest payment amount.
   SELECT max(amount)
   FROM `sakila`.`payment`;

4. Get the number of records in the customer table for store id #1.
   SELECT * 
   FROM sakila.customer 
   WHERE store_id = '1';

5. Get all payment records for customer with email address "NANCY.THOMAS@sakilacustomer.org"
  SELECT * 
  FROM sakila.payment
  WHERE customer_id = '12';

6. Use a View to get the film info for actor Bob Fawcett.
	SELECT film_info FROM sakila.actor_info
         where first_name ='bob' 
        AND last_name ='fawcett';

7. Use a Stored Procedure to get the 4 inventory ids for the film "Alien Center" at Store #2. 
      set @p_film_count = 0;
      call sakila.film_not_in_stock(15, 2, @p_film_count);
     select @p_film_count;

8. Insert a new store. Ensure that you use TRANSACTION. (This one is possible but it's tough! Pay attention to constraints and the order that you are inserting data.) 
       START TRANSACTION;
       INSERT INTO store value(3,3,3,'2006-02-15 05:30:00.0000');
       COMMIT;

9. Update the timestamp to the current date/time for the new store you entered in the previous question. 
     UPDATE store set last_update= '2022-04-15 02:16:000'
     WHERE store_id = 3;

10. Delete the new store. 
    DELETE FROM sakila.store 
    WHERE store_id =3;
